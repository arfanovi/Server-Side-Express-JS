    1. Response
        => Response Body
            =  The response body is the main content that the server sends back to the client. It can be HTML, JSON, text, or other data types.


        => Response Header
            = Response headers provide additional information about the response, such as content type, length, and other metadata.


        => Response Status
            = The response status is a code that indicates the result of the HTTP request. Common status codes include 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Internal Server Error).

        => Response Cookies
            = Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client side and sent with each request to the server. They are often used for session management, personalization, and tracking.

        --------------------------
        In this example:

        || The server sets the Content-Type header to text/plain.

        || The server sets the response status to 200 OK.

        || The server sets a cookie named username with the value JohnDoe.
        
        || The server sends "This is Home Route" as the response body.
